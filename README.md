# Performance-comparison-of-SVM--LVQ-and-Backpropagation-network
Python code for comparing performance of LVQ, SVM and Backpropagation network

Compare the performance (quality and computational effort) of LVQ, Backprop, and SVM on a Pima diabetes dataset from the UCI database.  Further analyzed how sensitive to algorithm parameter are the results of each algorithm.
